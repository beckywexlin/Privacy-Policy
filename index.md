This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use our mobile application. We understand that the information you enter into this App relates to your recovery journey and is deeply personal. We take your privacy seriously.

We automatically collect device type and operating system version, app usage data (features used, session duration, navigation patterns), crash reports and error logs, and IP address and general location (city/state level only).

How We Use Your Information
We use the information you provide to create and maintain your user account, store and display your step work and recovery reflections, sync your data across your devices, track your progress through the 12 steps, improve App functionality and user experience, provide customer support, send important App updates (if you opt in), analyze how users interact with the App to improve features, and fix bugs and prevent crashes.

We do not sell your information to anyone. We do not share your recovery data with third parties (except as required by law). We do not use your information for targeted advertising. We do not share your data with AA or any recovery organizations. We do not contact you for marketing purposes (except App updates).

How We Store Your Information
Cloud Storage via Base44
Your data is stored on secure servers operated by Base44, our app development platform. All Base44 servers are located in the United States. Data is encrypted both in transit (using TLS encryption) and at rest. Base44 is SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 certified for security.

Data Access
You can access your data anytime through your account. Base44 platform administrators have technical ability to access data for maintenance and security purposes, but do not routinely view user content. We (Becky Wexlin, LLC) do not access your personal recovery data except when necessary for customer support or if required by law. No other users can see your data. Your entries are private to your account only.

Data Security Measures
We implement industry-standard encryption protocols, secure user authentication and password protection, row-level security that ensures users can only access their own data, regular security updates and monitoring, and automatic logout after period of inactivity.

Multi-Device Sync
If you log into your account on multiple devices, your data automatically syncs. This requires storing data on Base44's cloud servers. You can use the App on iPhone, iPad, or other iOS devices with the same account.

Data Sharing and Disclosure
We Do NOT Share Your Recovery Data
We will never sell, rent, or share your personal recovery information with third parties for their marketing purposes.

Service Providers
We work with the following service providers who may have access to your data: Base44 (app hosting and database platform, located in the United States) and Apple (payment processing through App Store, see Apple's privacy policy). These service providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only to provide services to us.

Analytics
We use Base44's built-in analytics to understand how users interact with the App. This helps us improve features and fix problems. Analytics data is aggregated and anonymized where possible, but may include which features are used most often, how long users spend in the App, common navigation patterns, and device and operating system information. You cannot opt out of analytics at this time, but we do not share this data with third parties.

Legal Requirements
We may disclose information if required by law, such as in response to a valid court order, subpoena, or legal process, to protect the safety of users or the public, to investigate fraud or security issues, to defend our legal rights, or to comply with government requests. We will notify you of legal requests for your data unless prohibited by law.
Future Advertising (Not Currently Active)
We do not currently display advertisements in the App. If we add advertising in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy before doing so and notify you through the App. Ads will be clearly labeled. We may share anonymized usage data with ad networks. You may have the option to remove ads through an in-app purchase.

Medical and Legal Disclaimers
Not Medical Advice
This App is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. This App is a tool for personal step work based on the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous. It is not a substitute for attending AA meetings, working with a sponsor, therapy, or medical treatment. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, mental health crisis, or thoughts of self-harm, please call 911, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988, or seek immediate professional help. The App does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations.

Not Affiliated with AA
This App is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. (AAWSO) or any AA entity. We are an independent tool that references the Big Book and the 12 steps as educational resources. Alcoholics Anonymous® and AA® are registered trademarks of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc.

HIPAA and Health Data
While we handle your recovery data with the same care as protected health information, we are not currently a HIPAA-covered entity. We are in discussions with our platform provider about implementing a Business Associate Agreement for full HIPAA compliance. We will update this policy once that agreement is in place.

International Users
Our App and servers are based in the United States. If you use the App from outside the United States, your data will be transferred to and stored in the United States, and U.S. privacy laws will apply to your data. By using the App, you consent to the transfer of your data to the United States.

When we make changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top, notify you through the App or via email, and significant changes will require your acceptance before continued use. You can always review the current policy at [insert URL once hosted].
Your continued use of the App after changes take effect means you accept the updated policy.

Security
We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
If you believe your account has been compromised, please contact us immediately at brasstacks12steps@gmail.com.
